# Next.js Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome ðŸ‘‹  
This is a personal repository documenting my journey of learning [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).  
I'll be adding notes, examples, and key concepts I study â€” everything from code snippets to quick explanations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

- Organize what I learn.
- Make it easier to review later.

## Each folder may include:

- `.md` files with notes
- Code examples and mini projects

## ðŸ›  Tools & Stack

- Next.js
- React
- JavaScript
- VSCode

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All examples are for learning purposes and might be simplified.
- Iâ€™ll update this repo as I progress through the course.
